# Governance

## Current model

The reference Kotlin validator is maintained by Tracedown contributors
as part of the [Lace](https://github.com/tracedown/lacelang) project.
Final decisions about implementation, API design, and release cadence
are made by the maintainers.

All meaningful contributions from the community are welcome and will be
integrated on merit.

## Relationship to the spec

This validator implements the Lace specification. The spec repository
([lacelang](https://github.com/tracedown/lacelang)) governs the
language itself. This repository governs the reference Kotlin
validator only.

## Decision process

- **Spec compliance**: if the validator diverges from the spec, the spec
  wins. File a bug.
- **API design**: discussed in GitHub issues or PR comments. The
  maintainers make the final call.
- **Dependencies**: this package has one runtime dependency (Gson) by design.

## Future

The goal is to move Lace to an independent foundation when adoption is
meaningful enough to warrant shared governance. Until then, Tracedown
stewards the project with the commitment to keep it open, neutral, and
welcoming to independent implementations.
